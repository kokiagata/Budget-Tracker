# Budget-Tracker
This budget tracker app tracks budgets by making users log in using their own authentication, using passport.js and bcrypt. Once users log in or register, they can start tracking their expenses, as the app uses MongoDB and mongoose to store the user's unique information in a database. Users can then easily get desired information about their budget by following the app's instructions.

This project was a great way to learn authentication as well as usage of database and extracting the data at the same time. This project enforced my skills for APIs and functionality.
