# Budget-Tracker
This budget tracker app tracks budgets by making users log in using their own authentication, using passport.js and bcrypt. Once users log in or register, they can start tracking their expenses, as the app uses MongoDB and mongoose to store the user's unique information in a database. Users can then easily get desired information about their budget by following the app's instructions. You can categorize by expense type and date as well when both storing the expense, and extracting the registered data.
